## Introduction

This repository contains configuration files for active Forknote networks.


## How to start

The easiest way to start a Forknote network is to see the configuration file of an already existing coin and modify it.

You can also start from scratch and create a new configuration file by using a simple text editor or by using our [configuration wizard](http://forknote.net/create/#/).


## Parameters

Full list of the available configuration options can be found here - [Forknote configuration options](http://forknote.net/documentation/daemon/#blockchain-options)


## Common mistakes

* **All network clients must have the same configuration file**
* You need at least 2 seed nodes
* 127.0.0.1 cannot be a seed node
* Use CRYPTONOTE_NAME with lower case chars only


## Tools

* [Create forknote configuration](http://forknote.net/create/#/)
